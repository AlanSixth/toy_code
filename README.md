# toy_code

This is a collection of my recent coding practices. Most of them depends on Eigen3 and gnuplot. The code in `toy_ros_space` requires ROS installed, and they can only be compiled by `catkin_make`.

    I am working on a nonliear optimization framework now. 

##Code explanation

* **LSProblem**
    
    Demonstrates how to use Eigen's LM algorithm and numerical diff function  

* **NonLinearOpt**
  
    A nonliear optimization framework

* **eigen\_code\_c\_skeleton**
  
  Code skeleton. Just used to reduce some cumbersome work to create now cmake project

* **kdtree**
  
  A python kdtree implementation

* **test\_line\_intersection**
  
  Random code...

* **toy\_ros\_space**
  
  A ROS space

* **aruco\_tracker.cpp**

    Demonstrates how to use aruco library to detect QR markers
